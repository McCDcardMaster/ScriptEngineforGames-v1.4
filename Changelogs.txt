			CHANGELOG FILE
======================================
Version 1.4 contains multiple changes

1. Now the version constructor 
	is downloaded separately using the link 
	from the repository.

1.1 To load the repository the written 
	constructor-wrapper is used.

1.2 Also, to install versions, the constructor-wrapper.properties 
	file has been added 
		Which contains a link to the required 
		constructor repository.

		  These changes mean that 
	the constructor will be loaded separately, 
which would reduce the file size in the future.

1.3 The interface was changed again in version 1.4; 
	it became simpler and not so eye-opening.
	
1.4 The progress bar has also been changed, 
		now it behaves slightly like gradle.
	(This is what I was inspired by when I made the constructor)
	
1.5 Fixed progress bar spam in the console when loading libraries

2. 				In the .constructorTemp folder, 
		all libraries are now categorized into constructor versions (currently it 1.4)
	This will be done for every new version and fixed for every old one, 
however their support will not last forever and eventually the repositories will be closed

2.1 Fixed the error: 
	"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyInstaller'"

2.2 now the time spent is displayed next to the progress bar
			It looks like this [0h 0m 0s]
	variables h, m, s 
		- these are hours, minutes and seconds
		

2.3 compilation task - still has no functionality :)
(I never came up with it. Or rather, I did, but I donâ€™t think that my idea will be used)

2.4 Minor change
	text "In version "Version" made some changes" in the CHANGELOG FILE
has been changed to: "Version "Version" contains multiple changes" :D

2.5 "constructor.bat" has been changed

3. Added the ability to perform multiple tasks in a row in the console

That's all, see you soon! - @McCDcardMaster
(If I don't abandon this script engine...)
